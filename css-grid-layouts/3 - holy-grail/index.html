      <img src="img/banner.png" alt="article banner">
      <p>Video games love you by providing a space where you can escape reality and immerse yourself in a world of your choosing. They offer challenges to overcome, stories to experience, and a sense of accomplishment when you succeed. Video games can also provide a sense of community, connecting you with other players and creating a shared experience. Additionally, video games often adapt to your playstyle and preferences, offering a personalized experience that caters to your needs and desires. All in all, video games are a form of entertainment that can offer love and fulfillment to those who engage with them.</p>
      <p>It is not accurate to say that video games hate you, as they are merely inanimate objects incapable of emotions. However, some video games may challenge you, frustrate you, or even punish you for your mistakes, which can feel like the game is "hating" you. This is because video games are designed to provide a challenge and a sense of accomplishment, and overcoming difficult obstacles is often part of that experience. While some players may feel discouraged or angry when they fail, others may relish the challenge and enjoy the sense of satisfaction that comes with finally succeeding. In either case, it is important to remember that video games are simply a form of entertainment and should be enjoyed in a way that is healthy and fulfilling for the individual player.</p>
