        <h1>Moony</h1>
        <p>As the moon is a natural satellite of Earth and plays a crucial role in regulating our planet's tides and climate, it is important to protect it from harmful human activities. To best protect the moon, we should avoid any activities that could disrupt its delicate balance, such as mining or excessive space debris. We should also support international efforts to designate the moon as a protected heritage site, with strict regulations on human activity and preservation of its unique features and resources.</p>
