            <p>
                Members of the public at large,
            </p>
            <p>
                Recently, images of Mario's iconic smile have appeared on the moon, causing some concern and confusion among the public.
                We would like to take this opportunity to dispel any fears and to encourage you to look upon this phenomenon with love and positivity.
            </p>
            <p>
                His smile has always been a symbol of hope, joy, and resilience.
                It reminds us that no matter how tough life gets, there is always something to smile about.
                And now, with His image upon the moon, this message of hope and positivity has been taken to new heights.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, we ask you not to be concerned with this occurrence, but to look upon it with love.
                His smile is a message of love and unity, reminding us that we are all connected, no matter where we are in the world.
                It is a symbol of our shared humanity, and a reminder that even in the face of overwhelming power, we can find the strength to carry on and smile like Him.
            </p>
            <p>
                We hope that this message of love and hope brings a smile to your face and provides comfort in these uncertain times.
                And, as always, we encourage you to keep gazing upon the moon, where the smile of our hero is always there to offer encouragement.
            </p>
            <p>
                With love and positivity,
